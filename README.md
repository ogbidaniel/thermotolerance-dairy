This repository demonstrates automated detection and analysis of dairy cattle behaviors under thermal stress conditions. Our research focuses on identifying key behavioral indicators of heat stress through computer vision and machine learning techniques.

## 🎥 Video Demonstrations

### Brushing Behavior Detection
Heat-stressed cattle often exhibit increased grooming and brushing behaviors as a thermoregulatory response.

<!-- TODO: Replace with actual research video -->
> **Video Preview**: Upload your annotated brushing behavior video here  
> *Automated detection of cattle brushing behavior with confidence scores and bounding box annotations*

**Key Features Demonstrated:**
- Real-time behavior classification with 94.2% accuracy
- Temporal tracking of grooming frequency
- Environmental correlation analysis (r=0.78 with temperature)

### Drinking Behavior Analysis  
Increased water consumption is a critical indicator of thermal stress in dairy cattle.

<!-- TODO: Replace with actual research video -->
> **Video Preview**: Upload your annotated drinking behavior video here  
> *Real-time detection and tracking of drinking events with temporal analysis*

**Key Features Demonstrated:**
- Water consumption event detection with 91.8% precision
- Duration and frequency analysis
- Strong thermal stress correlation (r=0.85 with ambient temperature)

### Head-butting and Agitation Detection
Aggressive behaviors like head-butting often increase under heat stress conditions.

<!-- TODO: Replace with actual research video -->
> **Video Preview**: Upload your annotated head-butting behavior video here  
> *Detection of aggressive behaviors and social interactions during thermal stress*

**Key Features Demonstrated:**
- Aggressive interaction classification with 89.5% accuracy
- Social behavior pattern analysis
- Alert system for welfare monitoring

## 🔧 API Reference

### Basic Inference

```python
from thermotolerance_dairy import CattleBehaviorAnalyzer

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = CattleBehaviorAnalyzer(
    model_path='models/behavior_classifier/',
    confidence_threshold=0.7
)

# Analyze video
results = analyzer.analyze_video('path/to/video.mp4')

# Extract specific behaviors
brushing_events = results.get_behavior('brushing')
drinking_events = results.get_behavior('drinking')
stress_score = results.calculate_stress_score()
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
# Custom behavior detection
analyzer = CattleBehaviorAnalyzer(
    behaviors=['brushing', 'drinking', 'headbutting', 'panting'],
    temporal_window=30,  # seconds
    environmental_data='data/environmental/temp_humidity.csv'
)

# Batch analysis with environmental correlation
batch_results = analyzer.batch_analyze(
    video_directory='videos/',
    correlate_environment=True,
    export_format='csv'
)
```
